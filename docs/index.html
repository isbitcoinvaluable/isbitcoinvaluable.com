          <h1>Is Bitcoin Valuable?</h1>

          <p>
            Think of Bitcoin as a global payment system that is made of two
            parts: 1) software and 2) network.
          </p>

          <p>
            Bitcoin is an
            <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin"
              >open-source software</a
            >
            that
            <a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/">anyone can run</a>.
            Bitcoin software is battle-tested since 2009.
          </p>

          <p>Bitcoin software creates Bitcoin network that anyone can join.</p>

          <p>
            Bitcoin network enables its participants to make transactions
            between each other - exchanging digital token called "bitcoin".
          </p>

          <p>
            You can make transactions on the Bitcoin network ONLY if you own
            bitcoin.
          </p>

          <p>
            The amount of bitcoins that will ever exist is limited to
            21,000,000.
          </p>

          <p>1 bitcoin is 100,000,000 satoshi.</p>

          <p>
            The smallest amount of Bitcoin that you can own is 0.00000001
            bitcoin or 1 satoshi.
          </p>

          <p>
            Bitcoins are NOT freely available to anyone who joins the Bitcoin
            network. Instead, Bitcoin software allows Bitcoin network
            participats to "earn bitcoins" by doing the work - maintaining the
            list of all transactions made on the Bitcoin network.
          </p>

          <p>
            All transactions between Bitcoin network participants are grouped
            into blocks and blocks are linked with each other creating a chain
            of blocks - or "blockchain".
          </p>

          <p>
            The act of grouping transactions into blocks is not free. It
            requires specialised hardware, software and time - or the work.
          </p>

          <p>
            Those Bitcoin network participants who do the work - group
            transactions into blocks and maintain the blockchain - are called
            "miners".
          </p>

          <p>
            Transactions on Bitcoin network are not free. Every transaction has
            a fee associated with it and is determined by Bitcoin software. Fees
            are paid in bitcoins. The fee is paid by those who initiate
            transactions and the fee is collected by miners for doing the work.
          </p>

          <p>
            As of February 2021, the Bitcoin network has 10k+ nodes distributed
            across the world: US - 19%, Germany - 18%, France - 6%, etc.
          </p>

          <p>
            Why would the value of bitcoin go up over time? Supply and demand.
            If more people would like to make transactions on Bitcoin network,
            then more demand would be for bitcoins.
          </p>

          <p>
            Remember: you can’t make a transaction on Bitcoin network without
            first owning at least 0.00000001 bitcoin or 1 satoshi.
          </p>

          <p>
            Why would more people want to transact on Bitcoin network over time?
            Because at the moment it’s the cheapest, fastest and safest system
            to transact large amounts of value. Comparing to what? To
            traditional options: banks, payment services, cash, gold, etc.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you think of the global market for transferring wealth - Bitcoin
            is the best product on that market right now.
          </p>

          <p>
            Would you use Bitcoin to pay for a cup of coffee? Unlikely. The
            value is too low, the fee is too high and it takes about 10 minutes
            for your transaction to be confirmed. Cash or a credit card would be
            a better alternative - if it's instant and free.
          </p>

          <p>
            Would you use Bitcoin to pay for a real estate purchase? Likely. The
            value is high, the fee is low and it takes only 10 minutes for your
            transaction to be confirmed. No better alternative at the moment.
          </p>

          <p>
            The higher the amount that you want to transfer - the better choice
            Bitcoin becomes. You can transfer
            <a
              href="https://www.cryptovantage.com/news/here-are-the-5-biggest-bitcoin-transactions-in-history/"
              >$1B of wealth in 10 minutes with a fee of less than $100</a
            >. Do you know of any other payment system that can beat that?
          </p>

          <p>
            A single bitcoin will be worth more if more people/institutions will
            want to transact on Bitcoin network.
          </p>

          <p>
            Bitcoin is not digital gold or store of value. Bitcoin is your
            access to the Bitcoin network. If you value the network, you will
            value bitcoin. If more and more people will value the Bitcoin
            network - then the demand for access to it will grow.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you ever will need to transfer large amounts of wealth, then
            owning some bitcoin today buys you an entry to the Bitcoin network
            in the future.
          </p>

          <p>
            Bitcoin today is a call option for access to Bitcoin network in the
            future.
          </p>

          <p>
            In that context, Bitcoin has no value outside of Bitcoin network. If
            you’re not planning on using Bitcoin network then bitcoin is
            worthless to you.
          </p>

          <p>
            In another context, if everyone will agree that bitcoin has value
            outside of Bitcoin network then that’s a different story.
          </p>

          <p>
            One hypothesis is that bitcoin is useful outside of the Bitcoin
            network because we need a modern replacement for gold. And by design
            bitcoins with its Bitcoin network, its ease of transfer, its limited
            supply, its divisibility, its security and its trust - might be the
            best modern alternative to gold that we have at present day.
          </p>

          <p>
            If we as a society agree that bitcoin is the new gold, then bitcoin
            is valuable because of that social contract alone.
          </p>

          <p>
            If we start comparing Bitcoin’s market cap to gold’s market cap - as
            of February 2021 it's $1T vs $10T - then bitcoin price will 10x from
            here. And in that case - pricing Bitcoin at $500k is reasonable:
            $10T (potential market cap) / $20M (maximum number of bitcoins) =
            $500k.
          </p>
